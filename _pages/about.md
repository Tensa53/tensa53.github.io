Hello everyone!

I am a Linux and FOSS enthusiast. My main field in CS is Software Engineering,
but I am also interested in Information Security and Artificial Intelligence.

I am pursuing a Master Degree in Software Engineering & IT Management at University of Salerno, where I've also completed a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science.

Apart from my name, you can find me somewhere online with the nickname of Tensa53.

Tensa (Zangetsu) is the [Zanpakuto](https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Zanpakut%C5%8D)
[spirit](<https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Zangetsu_(Zanpakut%C5%8D_spirit)>)'s
Bankai of Ichigo, the main character of Bleach. I really liked a lot this show when I was younger,
so I decided to pick this one as my username. Sometimes I also use Tensa as my profile picture.

Talking about the 53, this is the number I use the most when
I'm playing [organized basketball in a team](https://tensa53.github.io/assets/img/about/photo-basketball.jpg).
I've been using this one since I was a kid.

If you want to contact me on a formal way, you can send a mail or a message on LinkedIn. Otherwise, you can use Telegram.
