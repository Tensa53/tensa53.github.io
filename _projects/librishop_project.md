<a href="https://github.com/Tensa53/LibriShop">LibriShop</a> is a website that simulates an e-commerce platform where you can buy some books.

The main pages of this website are:

- **Home Page**: This is the first page you will see when you land on the website. Here you can see a carousel of books and search for a specific one;
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/librishop/screen/librishop_screen1.png" title="home image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

- **Book Page**: When you've picked a book, you can visit its dedicated page where you can view some other details about the book;
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/librishop/screen/librishop_screen2.png" title="book image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

- **Shopping Cart Page**: If you're sure that you want to buy that book, you can add it to the shopping cart and proceed confirming the order.
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/librishop/screen/librishop_screen3.png" title="cart image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

After you've completed the purchase of a book, you can review your order and eventually undo the order. For a complete experience on the shop, you can also
- **Edit your profile info**: In order to complete an order, you have to create an account and later you can also edit your info;
- **Add/Edit a delivery address and a payment method**: With the idea of simulating an e-commerce platform, when you do an order you can also have to specify 
the delivery address and a payment method or use the ones you've already saved for older orders.

Aside from the website, for this project we have the following deliverables:
- **Project Proposal (in Italian)**: Before starting this project, we had to make a project proposal where we described some details such as the layout of the pages,
the color scheme and the conceptual scheme of the database.

This project was realized for the Web Software Technologies class, and I've collaborated with <a href="https://github.com/mariantonietta-maselli">mariantonietta</a>.

You can find any other information for this project on the dedicated GitHub repository.
