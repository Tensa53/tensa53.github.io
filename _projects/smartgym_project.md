<a href="https://github.com/Tensa53/SmartGym">SmartGym</a> aims to simplify the distribution and the access of an exercise sheet for the athletes subscribed at the gym, through a mobile app system

The main functionalities of this mobile app are:

- **Register/Login as an athlete user**: In order to access the functionality of the system, you have to register as an athlete user and then do the login;
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/smartgym/screen/smartgym_screen1.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

- **Insert/Edit the athlete info**: After the registration and login, you can edit the info about the login and insert the athletic features;
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/smartgym/screen/smartgym_screen2.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

- **Create an exercise sheet**: As an athlete user, you can create an exercise sheet and choose which part of your body you want to train.
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/smartgym/screen/smartgym_screen3.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

When all the desired exercise are selection, you can view a recap and save the sheet or redo the selection. 
There are other functionalities that have not been implemented/integrated but only elicited and analyzed: 
- **Ways of creating the exercise sheet**: An exercise sheet could also be generated by the system or assigned by a trainer;
- **Trainer mode**: A Trainer user could share some exercise sheets, create new exercises and interact with the athletes;

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">

Aside from the mobile app, for this project we have the following deliverables:
- **Documentation (in Italian)**: The documentation for this project described all the phases of a typical software development life cycle, from the requirements elicitation 
to the testing and also including detailed documentation for specific implemented part of the system, such as the one presented next;
- **Genetic algorithm**: In order to increase the ways of creating the exercise sheet, we formalized a genetic algorithm that gives in output an ideal exercise sheet 
for an athlete, given his athletic features inserted in the system. For this specific part of the project, we created a dedicated <a href="https://github.com/Tensa53/VirtualTrainer">repository</a>.

This project was realized for the Software Engineering Class and Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence classes. I've collaborated with 
<a href="https://github.com/mariantonietta-maselli">mariantonietta</a> and <a href="https://github.com/DoctorMike46">DoctorMike46</a>.

You can find any other information for this project on the dedicated GitHub repository.
