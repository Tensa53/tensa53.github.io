<a href="https://github.com/Tensa53/wastegone">WasteGone</a> aims to help the citizens in all the activites related to
waste sorting.

We manage the development of this app with many different tools:

- **Work Breakdown Structure**: A hierarchical decomposition of every project's phase (e.g. implementation) in all task
and activities needed, with detailed time and cost estimation;
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/wastegone/screen/wastegone_screen1.png" 
      title="wbs image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

- **Task Assignment**: All the decomposed tasks have been assigned to a specific team member or for some subgroups of
the team;
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/wastegone/screen/wastegone_screen2.png" 
      title="financial image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

- **Network Diagram**: A graphical representation of the schedule and dependencies of the task and activities, defining
the project duration and critical path.
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/wastegone/screen/wastegone_screen3.jpg" 
      title="network image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

With all the task and activities defined for every project's phase, we conduct:

- **Risk Management**: The process of identifying, analyzing and defining a response to the risks, choosing an avoidance
  or mitigation strategy based on the probability/impatc matrix.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/wastegone/screen/wastegone_screen4_gresized.png" 
      title="risk image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/wastegone/screen/wastegone_screendoc.png" 
      title="docs image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Aside from the management process, for this project we have also:

- **Management Documentation (in Italian)**: The documentation for the management described the considered knowledge
  areas on the different process groups, such as budget, schedule, scope, task assignments, meetings, risks.
  In order to integrate everything together, we also produced a project charter;
- **Product Documentation (in Italian)**: The documentation for the product described all the phases of a typical
  software development life cycle, from the requirements elicitation to the testing;
- **Prototype app**: In order to complete the tasks related to implementation and testing, the dev team also developed a
  prototype for the requirements with the highest priority, through a well-defined set of guidelines
  for code writing and documentation.

This project was realized for the Software Project Management and Software Engineering classes.
I've collaborated with <a href="https://github.com/CPDant">CPDant</a> on the management side, and with a team of
7 Bachelor students for the development side.

You can find any other information for this project on the dedicated GitHub repository.
