<a href="https://github.com/Tensa53/wastegone">WasteGone</a> aims to help the citizens in all the activites related to waste sorting.

We manage the development of this app in many different ways:

- **Financial Analysis**: The definition of all project costs and benefits, considering the discount rate and the minimum number of years for payback;
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/wastegone/screen/wastegone_screen1.png" title="financial image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

- **Work Breakdown Structure**: A hierarchical decomposition of every project's phase (e.g. implementation) in all task and activities needed, with detailed time and cost estimation;
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/wastegone/screen/wastegone_screen2.png" title="wbs image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

- **Network Diagram**: A graphical representation of the schedule and dependencies of the task and activities, defining the project duration and critical path.

        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/wastegone/screen/wastegone_screen3.jpg" title="network image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

With all the task and activities defined for every project's phase, we conduct:
- **Risk Management**: The process of identifying, analyzing and defining a response to the risks, choosing an avoidance or mitigation strategy based on the probability/impatc matrix.

    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/wastegone/screen/wastegone_screen4_gresized.png" title="risk image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/wastegone/screen/wastegone_screendoc.png" title="docs image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Aside from the management process, for this project we have also:
- **Management Documentation (in Italian)**: The documentation for the management described the considered knowledge areas on the different process groups, such as budget,
schedule, scope, task assignments, meetings, risks. In order to integrate everything together, we also produced a project charter;
- **Product Documentation (in Italian)**: The documentation for the product described all the phases of a typical software development life cycle, 
from the requirements elicitation to the testing;
- **Prototype app**: In order to complete the tasks related to implementation and testing, the dev team also developed a prototype for the requirements with the
highest priority, through a well-defined set of guidelines for code writing and documentation.

This project was realized for the Software Project Management and Software Engineering classes. 
I've collaborated with <a href="https://github.com/CPDant">CPDant</a> on the management side, and with a team of
7 Bachelor students for the development side.

You can find any other information for this project on the dedicated GitHub repository.
